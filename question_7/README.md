# Look and Say numbers

# Status = Completed
<br>
In mathematics, the <b>look-and-say</b> sequence is the sequence of integers beginning as follows;
<br><br>
<b>1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, 312211, 13112221, 1113213211, ...</b>
<br><br>
To generate a member of the sequence from the previous member, read off the digits of the previous member, counting the number ofdigits in groups of the same digit.
For example:

<b>1</b> is read off as "<b>one 1</b>" or <b>11</b>.
<br>
<b>11</b> is read off as "<b>two 1s</b>" or <b>21</b>.
<br>
<b>21</b> is read off as "<b>one 2, then one 1</b>" or <b>1211</b>.
<br>
<b>1211</b> is read off as "<b>one 1, one 2, then two 1s</b>" or <b>111221</b>.
<br>
<b>111221</b> is read off as "<b>three 1s, two 2s, then one 1</b>" or <b>312211</b>.

# So the question is how to calculate look and say number and find 30th element length?
