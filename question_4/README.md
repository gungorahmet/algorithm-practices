# Division without divide

This problem was asked by Nextdoor.<br><br>

Implement integer division without using the division operator.<br>
Your function should return a tuple of (dividend, remainder) and<br>
it should take two numbers, the product and divisor.

For example, calling divide(10, 3) should return (3, 1) since the<br>
divisor is 3 and the remainder is 1.<br><br>
Bonus: Can you do it in O(log n) time?
