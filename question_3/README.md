This problem is asked by Google.<br><br>
You are given a series of arithmetic equations as a string, such as;<br>

y = x + 1<br>
5 = x + 3<br>
10 = z + y + 2<br>

The equations use addition only and are seperated by newlines. Return a mapping of all variables to their values.<br>
If it's not possible, then return null.<br><br>
In this example, you should return:<br>

{<br>
	x: 2,<br>
	y: 3,<br>
	z: 5<br>
}
